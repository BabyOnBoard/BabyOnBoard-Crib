# BabyOnBoard-Crib

## Installing and running BabyOnBOard Crib app:

### On Terminal

````
sudo apt-get update 
sudo apt-get install npm
sudo npm install n -g 
sudo n latest
sudo npm install -g @angular/cli 
````

In case you get stuck in an infinit loop on this last one, try: 

````
sudo npm install --unsafe-perm -g @angular/cli
````

In some cases, just cloning this repository wont work because of the initial configuration Angular 2 creates at the start of a new project. 
In order for it to work, create a new project:

````
ng new babyonboard-crib
cd babyonboard-crib
````

and replace the scr folder with the one on this repository. 

## The app

The Baby on Board Crib app is intended to run alongside the Baby on Board API (https://github.com/BabyOnBoard/BabyOnBoard-API). It communicates with it by HTTP protocol requirements. 

Its purpose is to  allow the user to pick a movement for the baby-crib to perform so the baby can sleep. It is what it's shown on the baby-crib's touch screen.
